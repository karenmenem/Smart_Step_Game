# Missing ASL Videos for Subtraction

## Required for Subtraction Questions

### Numbers (missing):
- 5.mp4 (needed for questions with number 5)
- 22.mp4 (for future use)
- 26.mp4 (for future use)
- 27.mp4 (for future use)

### Operations (missing):
- **minus.mp4** - CRITICAL for all subtraction questions
- **equals.mp4** - CRITICAL for showing = sign

## Current Status

✅ 10 Subtraction Beginner L1 questions created (IDs 154-163)
✅ ASL mapping added to all questions
⚠️ Some videos missing - questions will show placeholders until videos are added

## How to Add Missing Videos

1. Download/create the missing ASL videos
2. Place them in the correct folders:
   ```
   frontend/public/asl/numbers/5.mp4
   frontend/public/asl/operations/minus.mp4
   frontend/public/asl/operations/equals.mp4
   ```
3. Refresh the quiz page - videos will automatically load

## Temporary Workaround

The questions work fine without the videos - they just won't show ASL translation for the missing parts. The math quiz will still display the question and options normally.
